DnsClient takes as input the IP address of a root DNS server and a domain name to be resolved. 
The program establishes a UDP connection, queries through the DNS server and finds an intermediate server 
and keeps querying to obtain the IP address of the given domain name. There is a timeout of 5 seconds, 
if a packet is not sent within that time, it will be resent.
